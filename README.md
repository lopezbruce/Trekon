# Trekon

Trekon is a real-time web application that aims to help the food service industry. It allows waitresses or servers to store their total daily tips, hours worked, and notes in a calendar, and then displays reports, summaries, and statistics about the data so users can evaluate their own performance.

_Make sure nodeJS is installed_
